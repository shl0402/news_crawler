Instead, the company will use that factory space to build humanoid robots instead.\n\nAnd he seemed to suggest that selling electric vehicles, which Tesla helped to introduce to the global mass market, would soon be an afterthought for the company.\n\nMusk predicted the Cybercab, a two-seat self-driving “robotaxi” vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals, will eventually be sold in numbers “several times more” than all Tesla’s other vehicles combined.\n\nBut Tesla’s robotaxi service is still not in wide operation, using Tesla employees as “safety monitors” in the cars while other companies offer true driverless rides in far more cities. Meanwhile, the company’s EV sales and profits, which it still depends upon for the cash to fund its ambitious autonomous and AI future, continue to decline.\n\nTesla said Wednesday that its adjusted income fell 16% during the last three months of 2025. Its net income tumbled further, plunging 61% in the quarter and 46% for the year, or a $3.3 billion decline.\n\nThe company posted its biggest year-over-year sales volume drop ever in the fourth quarter and by far the biggest drop in annual sales at a company that at once been growing at nearly a 50% pace.\n\nAn electric charging station for Tesla cars in Bochum, Germany. Ina Fassbender/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTesla’s earning have fallen in nine of the last 10 quarters. As of 2025, the company’s annual income is only 30% of the $12.6 billion it was in 2022, its peak earnings year.\n\nThe brand’s reputation took a hit last year among some American and European buyers – backlash to Musk’s political activities and his close relationship with President Donald Trump. And all US EV sales dropped off later in the year following the elimination of a $7,500 US tax credit for EV buyers.\n\nTesla also faces increased competition from other automakers, particularly in China, Tesla’s second largest market behind the United States. In fact, Tesla in 2025 lost its title of world’s largest electric vehicle maker to Chinese automaker BYD.\n\nThe end of the Model S and Model X will have a limited impact on Tesla’s sales. Together they make up only 3% of its global deliveries. Production is due to end at some point next quarter.\n\nIn its earnings report, the company disclosed for the first time that Tesla reached a deal to invest $2 billion in xAI. The AI company, which Musk owns and started in 2023, also owns his social media platform, X.\n\nThe promise of robotaxis and robots was enough to lift the stock to a record level in December, although it has retreated somewhat since that peak.\n\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) rose slightly in after-hours trading after the company said in its earnings statement that it planned to expand its robotaxi service to seven markets in the first half of this year. That’s on top of the two it currently serves.\n\nThe company previously said that its robotaxi service would serve half of the US population by the end of 2025. Musk reiterated that goal on Wednesday, saying between a quarter to half of the United States will have fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2026, “pending regulatory approval.”\n\nThe story has been updated with additional details.", "Image_URLs": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1322378070.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "https://www.cnn.com/media/sites/cnn/google-play-cnn-app-qr-code.png", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1322378070.jpg?c=original&q=w_860,c_fill", "https://www.cnn.com/media/sites/cnn/app-store-cnn-app-qr-code.png", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/251106-teslavote-wide-00-00-57-13-still001.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25173749904431.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2240736585.jpg?c=original&q=w_860,c_fill"], "Price_At_News_Time": 98.30000305175781, "Price_Open": 98.4000015258789, "Price_Close": 98.30000305175781, "Price_Change_Percent": -0.1016, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-27 15:30:00+08:00", "News_URL": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/business/tesla-q4-2025-earnings?.tsrc=rss"}

This new agreement builds on that foundation and expands the scope of collaboration.\n\nSupply chain support is another key component of the partnership. ExxonMobil will leverage its global production network, logistics capabilities and supply chain expertise to deliver compliant lubricant products to BYD’s overseas production facilities on time. This support aims to strengthen BYD’s ability to respond more quickly and reliably to global market trends.\n\nIn addition to supply chain support, the partnership will also focus on new material innovations, making vehicles more sustainable. This demonstrates the partnership’s shared goal of improving hybrid technology while supporting energy efficiency and environmental responsibility.\n\nWhile financial terms, investment figures and product launch timelines have not been disclosed, the agreement signals BYD and ExxonMobil’s commitment to promoting cleaner and more efficient hybrid vehicles worldwide.\n\nOverall, BYD and ExxonMobil aim to advance PHEV technology, making hybrid vehicles more efficient, reliable and sustainable while reinforcing a shared commitment to cleaner, greener transportation worldwide.\n\nByd Co., Ltd.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\n\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 5, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\n\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\n\nZacks Consensus Estimate\n\nThis casino operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.1%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $1.01 billion, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nEstimate Revisions Trend\n\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.73% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for BYD\n\nEarnings Whisper\n\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\n\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.", "Image_URLs": [], "Price_At_News_Time": 101.80000305175781, "Price_Open": 101.0, "Price_Close": 101.80000305175781, "Price_Change_Percent": 0.7921, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-29 15:30:00+08:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-boyd-gaming-byd-150006577.html?.tsrc=rss"}

(BYDDY). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\n\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\n\nCurrently, Volkswagen AG Unsponsored ADR has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Byd Co., Ltd. has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VWAGY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\n\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\n\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\n\nVWAGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.38, while BYDDY has a forward P/E of 17.64. We also note that VWAGY has a PEG ratio of 1.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BYDDY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.39.\n\nAnother notable valuation metric for VWAGY is its P/B ratio of 0.27. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BYDDY has a P/B of 3.34.\n\nThese metrics, and several others, help VWAGY earn a Value grade of A, while BYDDY has been given a Value grade of C.\n\nVWAGY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that VWAGY is likely the superior value option right now.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As Musk’s SpaceX prepares for a high-profile IPO, China’s growing ambitions in orbital artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are adding a new layer of competition.\n\nBYD Dethrones Tesla\n\nIn 2025, BYD overtook Tesla to become the world’s largest EV seller for the first time on an annual sales basis. BYD sold around 2.25 million electric-powered vehicles, up roughly 28% year over year. Tesla, meanwhile, reported two straight years of falling sales and profits. Several factors weighed on Tesla, including an aging product lineup and stiff competition from Chinese automakers. Also, investors grew uneasy about Musk’s political involvement. BYD, on the other hand, benefited from scale, pricing power and strong domestic demand in China.\n\nBut what began as competition around Tesla is now expanding into other areas of Musk’s technology empire.\n\nChina Enters the Space AI Race\n\nChina’s primary space contractor, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (“CASC”), has announced plans to launch space-based AI data centers over the next five years, per Reuters. These systems aim to integrate cloud, edge and device-level computing.\n\nBasically, China wants data collected on Earth to be processed directly in orbit. This approach could improve speed, reduce transmission needs and allow more complex AI tasks to run off-planet.\n\nThe timing is striking. Just as SpaceX is contemplating an IPO centered on orbital AI ambitions, China is signaling that it plans to compete head-on in the same space. After BYD dethroned Tesla in EVs, the parallels are hard to ignore.\n\nSpaceX’s Big Bet: AI Data Centers in Orbit\n\nSpaceX is preparing for what could be one of the largest IPOs in recent history. A major part of that story is AI.\n\nMusk wants SpaceX to deploy AI data centers in orbit. Data centers on Earth are running into energy limits. Power grids are stretched, electricity costs are rising and cooling massive AI servers is becoming harder. Space, by contrast, offers abundant solar energy and natural cooling.\n\nSpaceX plans to launch solar-powered AI data center satellites within the next two to three years. These orbital systems could process data directly in space, reducing pressure on Earth-based infrastructure and opening new possibilities for AI workloads.\n\nSpaceX is not alone in this race. Several global technology leaders, including Alphabet GOOGL, NVIDIA NVDA and Blue Origin, are actively exploring space-based data centers.", "Image_URLs": [], "Price_At_News_Time": 97.75, "Price_Open": 97.8499984741211, "Price_Close": 97.75, "Price_Change_Percent": -0.1022, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-30 15:30:00+08:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beating-tsla-evs-china-eyeing-130300588.html?.tsrc=rss"}

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alibaba (BABA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.28, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.28 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88% and 4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BABA\n\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for BABA\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\n\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Let’s take a look at what’s driving their upside potential and why investors remain bullish on these stocks.\n\nTSMC Poised for Major Gains as AI Expands\n\nContinued strong demand for TSMC’s leading-edge process technologies is expected to drive future growth, as it has in the past. For the first quarter of 2026, TSMC projects revenues between $34.6 billion and $35.8 billion, according to investor.tsmc.com. This would surpass fourth-quarter 2025’s $33.73 billion, a 25.5% year-over-year increase and a 1.9% sequential rise.\n\nTSMC’s profitability is set to strengthen, with the company expecting its gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2026 to be between 63% and 65%, slightly higher than the fourth quarter of 2025’s 62.3%. As more AI hyperscalers build new data centers, demand for TSMC’s chips powering these computing units is expected to increase, driving higher profit margins.\n\nAs a result, TSMC is expected to see earnings growth of 46.2% for the current quarter and 29.1% for the full year. TSMC’s $14.01 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) implies growth of 27.1% year over year.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBrokers are also bullish on TSMC’s prospects. They predict TSMC stock’s average short-term price target at $408, representing a 19.2% increase from the last close of $342.3. The highest target of $520 implies a potential upside of 51.9%.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Set for Growth on Eased Trade Tensions and AI Demand\n\nSome investors may remain cautious on NVIDIA due to the potential impact of a U.S.-China trade conflict on its sales. The company also faces tough competition from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, especially as spending on data centers continues to rise.\n\nHowever, at the moment, the trade tensions between the United States and China have somewhat eased, which bodes well for NVIDIA. This is because China has allowed some of its selective tech players, including Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA and ByteDance, to purchase NVIDIA’s H200 AI chips.

(NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the Buzzing AI Stocks on Wall Street. On January 28, HSBC analyst Abhishek Shukla lowered the price target on the stock to $41.00 (from $44.00) while maintaining a Reduce rating. The firm believes that CoreWeave’s ongoing funding needs and high cost of capital may impact long-term productivity.\n\nThe firm has increased its interest cost estimates for CoreWeave due to a 250 basis points widening in the company’s credit default spread (CDS) spreads by the third quarter of 2025. This implies that the company will need to pay more than 10% yield for raising fresh debts. In 3Q25, CoreWeave was able to raise fresh debt at about 9% effective interest rate for the company, an assumption which the firm no longer views as sustainable.\n\nHSBC noted that while the company’s January 2026 $2 billion equity from Nvidia and its December issuance of 1.75% convertible notes may help put a lid on near-term interest costs, CRWV still likely faces a liquidity shortfall of USD 8.9 billion in 2026e.\n\nHSBC Cuts CoreWeave (CRWV) Price Target, Flags High Funding Needs and Rising Debt Costs\n\nPhoto by lucas law on Unsplash\n\nAs a result, the firm believes that the company will likely need to borrow more funds at current higher yields, in turn increasing its effective cost of debt.\n\n“Consensus continues to assume that the effective interest rate on debt for CoreWeave will dip to 7.7% in 2029e from 9.9% in 3Q25. We lower our 2027-30e non GAAP EPS estimates by 12-33% (on a very low base) due to higher interest expense. 2026e non-GAAP EPS, however, rises to USD0.15 (from negative USD0.06) on lower debt. Our 2027-30e non-GAAP EPS estimates remain 58-92% below consensus.”\n\nCoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is a cloud platform provider that provides equipment for AI and other computing purposes.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

{"Stock_Code": "0981.HK", "Category": "Chips", "News_Date": "2026-01-22T00:00:00", "News_Title": "Taiwan Semiconductor Just Delivered Great News for Nvidia Shareholders", "News_Source": "FOOL", "News_Content": "Taiwan Semiconductor has raised its growth projections.\n\nThe stock market is full of independent companies, but they are all intertwined. One may be a supplier, while another markets products. Another may be a designer, while another uses its products. As a result, investors can look for clues about one stock in other companies' earnings reports.\n\nRecently, I saw one such huge connection in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM 2.66%) fourth-quarter earnings report. TSMC, as it's also known, is the world's primary foundry for producing logic chips and supplies them to nearly every company in cutting-edge tech. One of its biggest clients is Nvidia (NVDA 0.72%), and the news that TSMC just delivered is huge for that client.\n\nTSMC's dominance makes it easy to trace beneficiaries\n\nThe world of logic-chip foundries is fairly small. There is TSMC and some lesser competitors that don't have the same level of dominance, such as Samsung. TSMC is really the only name in town after Intel's fall from grace. So, when the leading chip producer says that something good (or bad) is happening with demand, it's pretty easy to trace its downstream effects.\n\nDuring the company's fourth-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said that his company has increased its projection for artificial intelligence (AI) chips to a mid- to high-50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the period between 2024 and 2029. That's monstrous growth, and bodes well for some other predictions that Nvidia has already given shareholders.\n\nExpand NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today's Change ( -2.66 %) $ -9.03 Current Price $ 330.52 Key Data Points Market Cap $1.7T Day's Range $ 329.11 - $ 339.69 52wk Range $ 134.25 - $ 351.33 Volume 510K Avg Vol 13M Gross Margin 59.02 % Dividend Yield 0.93 %\n\nNvidia told investors that it expects global data-center capital expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. That equates to a 42% CAGR over that time frame, which is slightly less than what TSMC expects.\n\nThese two projections aren't exactly the same, but they are close enough that I think investors can take TSMC's projection as a confirmation of Nvidia's. This could be huge for the latter company since it would make an enormous amount of revenue in 2030 if it comes true.\n\nNvidia could come close to $1 trillion in revenue if the projection pans out\n\nWall Street analysts expect $213 billion in revenue for Nvidia's fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). Should the company's revenue check in at a 42% CAGR during the next four years through 2030, that would give it revenue of $866 billion. It would be quite the feat for the largest company in the world by market cap to quadruple revenue in four years, and would make it a no-brainer buy now if its projection pans out.\n\nThat would require Nvidia to maintain its market share, which won't be easy to do. However, I think it's certainly in a strong position to continue growing rapidly during the next four years, and investors who don't have exposure to Nvidia should think about changing that.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( -0.72 %) $ -1.39 Current Price $ 191.12 Key Data Points Market Cap $4.6T Day's Range $ 189.47 - $ 194.49 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 212.19 Volume 5.6M Avg Vol 182M Gross Margin 70.05 % Dividend Yield 0.02 %\n\nOne apprehension many investors have is the fear of an AI bubble. If one forms, it would likely affect Nvidia's stock. Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO has the same concern. He mentioned that he is \"very nervous\" about AI demand.\n\nHowever, he said his company did a lot of research and checked in with its biggest clients before making the decision to invest more than $50 billion in chip production capabilities. If it's wrong, Wei cautioned, TSMC is in trouble. However, he is very confident that the research is right, especially because he spent a significant amount of time in the past quarter ensuring demand is real.\n\nI think this should ease some fears about an AI bubble, because companies are doing their due diligence to ensure that AI demand is something that's here to stay. If it is, stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Nvidia have plenty of room to soar. I think each is an excellent investment option in 2026, and if you don't own them already, now is the perfect time to load up.", "Image_URLs":

{"Stock_Code": "0981.HK", "Category": "Chips", "News_Date": "2026-01-20T00:00:00", "News_Title": "Who Are the Biggest Winners from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's Blowout Quarterly Report?", "News_Source": "FOOL", "News_Content": "There are numerous other winners from TSMC's strong report and increased capital expenditures.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.66%) recently reported a blowout quarter, sending its stock higher. However, it's not the only stock set to be a winner from its strong report and outlook.\n\nWhen the company projected it would spend between $52 billion and $56 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2026, up from $41 billion in 2025, it sent a clear message that the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips has staying power. Let's look at other stocks set to benefit from the same dynamics it's seeing.\n\nAI chipmakers\n\nTSMC ramping up capex to build out new fabs is good news for its customers, who it said continue to seek out increased capacity. Nvidia (NVDA 0.72%) is a clear winner, given that its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the primary chips used to train large language models (LLMs). Given the wide moat it has with CUDA for AI model training, it will continue to be a significant beneficiary of AI infrastructure spending.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO +0.17%) is also set to benefit, as it continues to help its customers design custom AI chips. Citigroup analysts see Broadcom having the potential to increase its AI revenue fivefold over the next two years. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 6.09%), meanwhile, has a strong position in the data center central processing unit (CPU) market, and its GPUs should benefit from an expanding market for AI inference, where Nvidia has a narrower moat.\n\nExpand NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today's Change ( -2.66 %) $ -9.03 Current Price $ 330.52 Key Data Points Market Cap $1.7T Day's Range $ 329.11 - $ 339.69 52wk Range $ 134.25 - $ 351.33 Volume 510K Avg Vol 13M Gross Margin 59.02 % Dividend Yield 0.93 %\n\nASML\n\nMore capex spending from TSMC means it will need more machines that can manufacture advanced semiconductors. ASML (ASML 2.21%) is the big winner here, as it is the only company that makes the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines needed to manufacture these chips.\n\nMeanwhile, as TSMC looks to push the limits on advanced chip architecture, it sets AMSL up to eventually begin selling the foundry its newer High-NA EUV platform, which costs nearly double its EUV machines.\n\nMemory makers\n\nFor AI chips to perform to their fullest potential, they need high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is a specialized form of DRAM (dynamic random access memory). The memory market for DRAM is currently very tight, leading to rising prices, and TSMC aggressively spending to increase AI chip capacity is likely only to keep it in short supply. That bodes well for DRAM companies like Micron Technology (MU 4.80%), SK Hynix, and Samsung (SSNL.F +55.02%), which are all already benefiting from huge demand and increasing prices.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : ASML ASML Today's Change ( -2.21 %) $ -32.16 Current Price $ 1423.00 Key Data Points Market Cap $552B Day's Range $ 1416.01 - $ 1466.43 52wk Range $ 578.51 - $ 1493.47 Volume 2.4M Avg Vol 1.6M Gross Margin 52.80 % Dividend Yield 0.52 %\n\nCloud computing and neocloud companies\n\nTwo other segments set to benefit from TSMC's strong outlook are cloud computing and neocloud companies. The big three cloud computing companies -- Amazon (AMZN 1.00%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.83%), and Alphabet (GOOG 0.04%) (GOOGL 0.04%) -- along with Oracle (ORCL 2.62%), are all spending aggressively to build out their data center capacity to meet increasing demand for AI services.\n\nOn its earnings call, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said he spoke to all the big cloud service providers, and they gave him evidence that AI is helping their businesses, and that their infrastructure spending is driving strong returns. Without that assurance and evidence, he would not have increased TSMC's capex to the level he did. That is great news for these companies, as right now, cloud computing is the bigger driver of their businesses.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : GOOGL Alphabet Today's Change ( -0.07 %) $ -0.25 Current Price $ 338.00 Key Data Points Market Cap $4.1T Day's Range $ 332.29 - $ 340.00 52wk Range $ 140.53 - $ 342.29 Volume 31M Avg Vol 35M Gross Margin 59.18 % Dividend Yield 0.25 %\n\nMeanwhile, this also bodes well for the smaller neocloud providers like CoreWeave (CRWV 6.37%) and Nebius Group (NBIS 10.24%). These companies specialize in renting out the computer power needed to handle AI workloads, and demand for their services has been through the roof. However, they don't have the balance sheets and free cash flow of the big three cloud computing providers, and are more leveraged plays.\n\nTSMC's commitment to more capex is a big vote of confidence that the economics of the AI cloud computing model work.", "Image_URLs":

{"Stock_Code": "0981.HK", "Category": "Chips", "News_Date": "2026-01-30T00:00:00", "News_Title": "The 5 Best Stocks to Buy for 2026", "News_Source": "FOOL", "News_Content": "Artificial intelligence is still a major market theme in 2026.\n\nWith the first month of 2026 nearly over, there are some themes starting to take shape. First, investors are still skeptical that artificial intelligence (AI) spending is real. However, if you paid attention to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM 2.66%) fourth-quarter results, then you know that it's real and only going to get bigger.\n\nHowever, the market hasn't caught on to that yet. That leads to a few stocks looking like incredible buys, but there are also some other non-AI stocks that look like strong buys for 2026 that are suffering a bit from a 2025 hangover.\n\nI think these are among the best stocks to buy now, and investors should consider doing so as soon as possible, before the market catches on.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nIt should be no surprise that Nvidia (NVDA 0.72%) is included in this list. It's still the top AI computing provider, and its graphics processing units (GPUs) continue to push the limit of what's possible with traditional computing. Demand for its GPUs continues to grow, and will likely increase through 2030, when Nvidia believes there will be $3 trillion to $4 trillion in global annual data center spending.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : NVDA Nvidia Today's Change ( -0.72 %) $ -1.38 Current Price $ 191.13 Key Data Points Market Cap $4.6T Day's Range $ 189.47 - $ 194.49 52wk Range $ 86.62 - $ 212.19 Volume 179M Avg Vol 182M Gross Margin 70.05 % Dividend Yield 0.02 %\n\nThat's a huge projection, and if it actually turns out to be correct, the stock will be a must-own. I think the tailwinds in the AI realm are still howling, making Nvidia a no-brainer to buy this year.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nAs mentioned above, Taiwan Semiconductor already reported fourth-quarter results and crushed it. Revenue was up 26% year over year in U.S. dollars, and management gave guidance for nearly 30% revenue growth in 2026. Underscoring this announcement was its decision to spend $52 billion to $56 billion on production capabilities throughout the year.\n\nExpand NYSE : TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Today's Change ( -2.66 %) $ -9.03 Current Price $ 330.52 Key Data Points Market Cap $1.7T Day's Range $ 329.11 - $ 339.69 52wk Range $ 134.25 - $ 351.33 Volume 510K Avg Vol 13M Gross Margin 59.02 % Dividend Yield 0.93 %\n\nThis shows there is huge and lasting chip demand in the AI space, giving further credence to the idea that AI spending is just getting started.\n\n3. Nebius\n\nNebius Group (NBIS 10.24%) is less known than the previous two because it's a smaller business that's deploying Nvidia GPUs filled with TSMC chips to be rented out to clients looking for AI training power. This is a similar business model to the already proven cloud computing one that several big tech companies use. By focusing on AI, they are targeting a niche that needs as much computing power as possible as soon as possible.\n\nDemand for Nebius' platform to expand is incredible, and management believes it will grow from a $551 million annual run rate at the end of the third quarter to a $7 billion to $9 billion run rate at the end of the year. That's a huge increase that I want to be a part of, since the stock a great buy now.\n\n4. The Trade Desk\n\nMoving to stocks not focused on AI, The Trade Desk (TTD 2.90%) is one I think will have a strong comeback in 2026. The Trade Desk had an abysmal 2025, falling nearly 70%. However, I think that decline is overblown, because Wall Street analysts still expect 18% revenue growth for this year and 16% next year.\n\nThe demand for ad technology software is still growing, and The Trade Desk is in position to capture it. But because of recent pessimism, you can now buy the stock at a mere 17.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThat's an absolute steal of a price, and investors should be flocking to the stock.\n\n5. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI 3.17%) is a diversification play, since its business is based in Latin America, giving investors exposure to a different part of the world. While I'm not a fan of diversifying just for diversification's sake, MercadoLibre is a business well worth owning. It has built itself into an e-commerce giant, complete with a fintech platform in Latin America. As a result, MercadoLibre has its hand in many transactions that occur in that part of the world.\n\nExpand NASDAQ : MELI MercadoLibre Today's Change ( -3.17 %) $ -70.35 Current Price $ 2147.79 Key Data Points Market Cap $109B Day's Range $ 2129.00 - $ 2226.68 52wk Range $ 1723.90 - $ 2645.22 Volume 559K Avg Vol 541K Gross Margin 45.14 %\n\nThe stock is down around 20%, which happens now and again because the market sometimes forgets it's not associated with the U.S. This makes it a perfect buying opportunity because the company has a fantastic record of increasing the business. There is still a large part of the Latin American population that hasn't come onto the platform yet, leaving plenty of room for MercadoLibre to expand.", "Image_URLs":
