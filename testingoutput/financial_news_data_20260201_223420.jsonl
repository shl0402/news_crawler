A deal with Ford stands to give the company a new revenue stream, especially as it grapples with heightened competition and cooling sales in mainland Chinese markets. \nFor Ford, a deal with BYD grants access to cheaper batteries and advanced EV technology. Ford had recently scrapped several EV models, and signaled a pivot into hybrid vehicles, amid waning demand for EVs in its core American market. \n Should you be buying F right now?\nProPicks AI evaluates F alongside thousands of other companies every month using 100+ financial metrics.\n\nUsing powerful AI to generate exciting stock ideas, it looks beyond popularity to assess fundamentals, momentum, and valuation.

Ltd.\nThis growth is attributed by rapid adoption of renewable energy, growing electrification across industries, and widespread deployment of utility-scale, residential, and commercial storage solutions; with aggregated battery capacity nearing 280 GWh, over 10 million households relying on compact units, and second-life EV packs mitigating e-waste, modular systems from leaders like Tesla, LG, BYD, Panasonic, and Siemens are stabilizing grids, enabling behind-the-meter energy management, and supporting microgrids, while advanced dispatch systems and on-grid installations enhance real-time load balancing, voltage support, and frequency stabilization across Asia, North America, and Europe.\nChicago, Jan. 30, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global battery energy storage system market was valued at 8.08 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 68.22 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 26.75% from 2025 to 2033.\nThe battery energy storage system market terrain has accelerated remarkably in 2024, boosted by the expanding adoption of renewable power sources and widespread electrification across industries. As nations seek cleaner grids, around 1,500 operational storage projects now stabilize utility-scale power worldwide, mitigating voltage dips and smoothing peak demands. In parallel, the presence of more than 30 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) underscores the urgent demand for advanced charging infrastructure. With total renewable electricity generation surpassing 10,000 terawatt-hours this year, battery-based solutions have taken center stage in offsetting the intermittency of wind and solar. About 2,200 terawatt-hours of that figure stem from solar alone, catalyzing an upsurge in behind-the-meter deployments. Commercial sites are also adopting energy storage in record numbers, with nearly 4,000 on-site battery installations supporting backup power and cost optimization. These developments are accompanied by significant research endeavors, including collaborative projects among 25 nations seeking to design battery cells that can withstand upwards of 5,000 charge-discharge cycles.\nRequest Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/battery-energy-storage-system-market\nNote: This report is readily available for immediate delivery. We can review it with you in a meeting to ensure data reliability and quality for decision-making.\nAutomotive-Grade Packs Find Second Life, Reducing E-Waste and Supply Pressures\nBy 2024, aggregated battery storage capacity will have climbed to nearly 280 gigawatt-hours, reflecting a global transition toward more reliable and sustainable energy systems. Roughly 10 million households now rely on compact residential battery units in the battery energy storage system market, helping to safeguard against grid disruptions. Automotive-grade packs from retired electric vehicles are increasingly funneled into second-life projects, reducing e-waste and alleviating supply constraints for new cells. In response to mounting competition, major industry players such as Tesla, LG Energy Solution, BYD, Panasonic, and Siemens have presented modular solutions for everything from suburban microgrids to commercial skyscrapers. This multi-faceted approach helps ensure stable power whenever renewable outputs fluctuate. To future-proof grids, at least 12 major energy conglomerates worldwide have commissioned pilot programs harnessing solid-state battery prototypes that promise higher energy density and improved safety metrics. With governments, utilities, and the private sector working in tandem, battery energy storage continues to gain traction as a linchpin technology for advancing renewable integration, reducing carbon footprints, and modernizing aging electrical infrastructure.\nStory Continues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 4264, "Word_Count": 573, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8cvs4Vdz6uI4Y6rzp3KbEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTQyMDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/dc7cef0d35ec22446236715ef3d86dcc"], "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battery-energy-storage-system-market-170900260.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 9.30925989151001}

This shift aligns with tighter emissions rules, expanding charging networks, and broader policy support for electrification. For investors, it places BYD alongside long established brands in a region that has been a key market for global automakers.\nAs electric cars gain share, attention may focus on how BYD positions its product range, pricing, and local partnerships across Europe. Readers may want to watch how regulators, incumbents, and consumers respond to the growing role of Chinese brands, since that can influence competitive pressure and capital allocation decisions across the sector.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for BYD by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on BYD.\nSEHK:1211 1-Year Stock Price Chart\nWhy BYD could be great value\nBYD's surge in European electric vehicle registrations, while fully electric cars slightly outsold petrol models for the first time, suggests investors are seeing the company as a credible contender to Tesla and Volkswagen in a key global market. For you, this points to growing investor attention on how BYD executes on distribution, brand-building and local production as Europe leans further into battery electric vehicles.\nHow this fits into the broader BYD narrative\nThe shift in buyer interest toward fully electric cars gives more weight to narratives that view BYD as a long-term EV specialist rather than just a China-focused automaker. Investors who already followed BYD for its vertical integration in batteries and vehicles may read this European traction as an extension of that story into a region where competitors like Tesla, Volkswagen and Stellantis are already well known.\nRisks and rewards investors are weighing\nBYD's strong registration growth in Europe suggests rising brand visibility with consumers and investors compared with peers such as Tesla and Volkswagen.\nGrowing EV share in Europe supports interest in companies focused on battery electric models, which aligns with BYD's core offering.\nAnalysts have flagged a risk tied to the quality of earnings, with a high level of non cash earnings that investors may want to understand in more detail.\nCompetition from established European brands and other Chinese manufacturers could affect pricing power and investor confidence if market share gains slow.\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 3252, "Word_Count": 502, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TJN1Y.SdzyO01HwFDmALMA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY2NDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/887aeaefba898f3ffc0a62642cd9ac29"], "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/byd-european-ev-surge-puts-171518197.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 7.747776508331299}

Over the past month and year to date, the stock shows a 7.4% and 4.9% decline respectively, and a 7.2% decline over the past week. This backdrop frames a company that has already seen substantial medium term appreciation while working through shorter term share price pressure.\nFor investors, the shift toward AI, robotics, and autonomy, combined with the $2b xAI investment and merger rumors, raises fresh questions about how to think about Tesla's future business mix. As the company pivots from its oldest vehicle lines toward Optimus and related technologies, the key issues will center on execution, capital allocation, and how these moves reshape Tesla's role across the broader tech and manufacturing sectors.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for Tesla by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Tesla.\nNasdaqGS:TSLA Earnings & Revenue Growth as at Jan 2026\nHow Tesla stacks up against its biggest competitors\nTesla’s decision to phase out Model S and Model X to free up Fremont capacity, ramp Optimus humanoid robot production and invest US$2b into xAI marks a clear bet that AI, robotics and autonomy will be central to its future business mix rather than premium passenger cars. This comes after a tougher 2025, with full year revenue at US$94.8b versus US$97.7b a year earlier and net income at US$3.8b versus US$7.1b. The pivot appears designed to reorient capital and factory space toward areas management sees as higher potential, while the Semi truck and Cybercab timelines, plus the Pilot Travel Centers charging deal, still keep Tesla anchored in transport and energy infrastructure.\nTesla’s AI and Robotics Pivot Through the Narrative Lens\nIf you have been following community narratives that frame Tesla as an AI and robotics platform rather than just an automaker, this news fits squarely into that storyline. The heavy focus on Optimus, robotaxis and xAI-supported autonomy, alongside existing commentary about future robot and software revenue, shows management leaning into the thesis that software, services and physical AI could one day sit alongside or even rival the traditional EV business, while competitors such as BYD, Volkswagen and Mercedes remain more focused on cars first.\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 3265, "Word_Count": 519, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pSrLUC9gFCNwpwDUk3Dygw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYxMztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/92bd23028ef3fc977fb9f7cd406d207f"], "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-reorients-premium-evs-optimus-061806827.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 6.5879998207092285}

Over 7 million investors trust Simply Wall St to stay informed where it matters for FREE.\nIf you are wondering whether BYD's current share price reflects its true worth, you are not alone, as many investors are asking the same question before making their next move.\nBYD's shares last closed at HK$98.5, with returns of a 2.2% decline over 7 days, 5.2% over 30 days, a 0.3% decline year to date, 8.7% over 1 year, 27.2% over 3 years, and 24.6% over 5 years, a mixed set of numbers that naturally raises questions about value and risk.\nRecent headlines around BYD have focused on its position in electric vehicles and batteries, alongside ongoing attention on how competition and regulation affect major auto makers. These themes provide helpful context when thinking about how the stock has traded and what could be influencing sentiment.\nRight now BYD has a valuation score of 2 out of 6, which means it screens as undervalued on 2 of the 6 checks used in the analysis. Next, we look at how different valuation methods assess the stock, before finishing with a way of thinking about value that goes beyond any single model.\nBYD scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\nApproach 1: BYD Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\nA Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to today’s value. It is essentially asking what those future CN¥ cash flows are worth in present terms.\nFor BYD, the latest twelve month free cash flow is a loss of CN¥29,051.48m. Analysts and internal estimates project CN¥61,159.21m of free cash flow in 2026 and CN¥73,877.89m in 2027, with further CN¥ cash flows projected each year out to 2035 using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Simply Wall St uses analyst estimates where available, then extends the series using its own growth assumptions.\nWhen all those projected cash flows are discounted back, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of HK$135.32 per share, compared to the recent share price of HK$98.50. This implies the shares trade at a 27.2% discount to this DCF estimate, which indicates the stock screens as undervalued on this model.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests BYD is undervalued by 27.2%.

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\nBYD, ticker SEHK:1211, is stepping up its global expansion with new moves in India, Mexico, and Vietnam.\nIn India, the company is exploring local assembly options to work around import restrictions on electric vehicles.\nIn Mexico, BYD is adjusting its plans in response to higher tariffs that affect imported vehicles and components.\nIn Vietnam, BYD is partnering on a new EV battery plant that would broaden its manufacturing base in Southeast Asia.\nAt a current share price of HK$97.75, BYD is in a phase where investors are weighing its China exposure against its push into overseas markets. The stock has gained 8.6% over the past 1 year and 18.7% over 3 years, while the year-to-date return stands at a 1% decline. This context highlights international expansion as an important part of the story for SEHK:1211 and illustrates where management is focusing its efforts geographically as domestic growth slows.\nFor investors, a key question is how effectively BYD can build and operate capacity in markets such as India, Mexico, and Vietnam while managing tariffs and policy changes. The new battery plant partnership in Vietnam and possible local assembly in India could move more of its supply chain closer to end markets, which may influence costs, pricing power, and competitive positioning over time.\nStay updated on the most important news stories for BYD by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio.

Local assembly in India and potential plant investments in Mexico and Vietnam could give the company more control over tariffs, logistics, and model mix in markets where competitors such as Tesla and Volkswagen are also trying to expand their presence.\nBYD narrative, from China champion to global capacity builder\nThis news fits a wider story of BYD trying to shift from a mainly China-focused EV and battery producer to a more balanced global operator. Investors following the BYD narrative may see these projects as part of a longer-term effort to match manufacturing footprints with overseas demand rather than relying heavily on exports from China.\nRisks and rewards for investors to weigh\n🎁 Potential for better pricing and cost control if local assembly in India and tariffs in Mexico are managed through on-the-ground capacity and flexible sourcing.\n🎁 The Vietnam battery plant can broaden BYD's supply base in Southeast Asia and support more regional vehicle production partnerships.\n⚠️ Higher tariffs in Mexico and policy shifts in large markets add execution risk if new facilities do not reach efficient scale quickly.\n⚠️ Faster overseas build out requires capital and management focus, which may stretch operations while BYD also competes with Tesla, Volkswagen, and others in key EV markets.\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 3407, "Word_Count": 548, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OWN26h15q0WBWxKjMbNJ7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYxMztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/17b0e84622d2fb9c7e9cd0e645ef9f2c"], "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/byd-expands-beyond-china-capacity-161324993.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 6.612090826034546}
