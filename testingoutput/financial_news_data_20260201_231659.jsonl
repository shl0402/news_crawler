On a 1 year view, the total return figure provided is 14.2%.\nThe company reports revenue of CN¥841.1b and net income of CN¥38.3b. This reflects a large-scale operation across automobiles, batteries and related services. Annual revenue growth is given as 10.8%, with net income growth at 16.3%.\nAt the last close of HK$102.80, some valuation metrics in the data suggest a potential gap between market price and certain fair value estimates. However, these approaches depend heavily on the assumptions behind each model.\nSee our latest analysis for BYD.\nRecent trading points to rebuilding momentum, with a 1 day share price return of 4.6% and a 7 day share price return of 3.8%, set against a 1 year total shareholder return of 14.2% that reflects steadier long term gains.\nIf BYD has you thinking more broadly about the auto space, it could be a good time to see what else is on the move among auto manufacturers.\nSo with BYD trading at HK$102.80 alongside fair value and price target estimates that sit higher, is the current share price a genuine gap you can exploit, or is the market already factoring in future growth?\nPrice to earnings of 21.7x: Is it justified?\nOn the latest numbers, BYD trades on a P/E of 21.7x, while our fair value work points to a lower P/E of 13.8x and the shares sit below some cash flow based estimates such as the SWS DCF model fair value of HK$136 versus the last close at HK$102.80.\nThe P/E ratio compares the current share price with earnings per share and is a common way for investors to judge how much they are paying for each unit of profit. For a large auto and battery group like BYD, a higher P/E can reflect expectations for further earnings progress as well as the breadth of its businesses across vehicles, batteries and related services.\nHere, the 21.7x P/E sits above both the Asian auto industry average of 18.2x and a peer average of 8.3x. This suggests the market is assigning BYD a richer earnings tag than many regional and peer names. Compared with the estimated fair P/E of 13.8x, the gap is also wide. This highlights a level that the market could move towards if sentiment or earnings expectations change.\nExplore the SWS fair ratio for BYD\nResult: Price to earnings of 21.7x (OVERVALUED)\nHowever, you still need to watch for earnings expectations resetting if sentiment toward higher P/E auto names cools or if analyst price targets are revised lower.\nFind out about the key risks to this BYD narrative.\nAnother view: Cash flow says something different\nIf you put the earnings multiple to one side and look at our SWS DCF model, you get a different message. On this view, BYD at HK$102.80 sits about 24.4% below an estimated fair value of HK$136, which points to potential upside rather than stretch.\nThat gap matters because it shows how sensitive conclusions can be to the tool you use, and to the assumptions built into it. If profits or cash flows play out differently, could this apparent cushion shrink or widen from here?\nLook into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.\n1211 Discounted Cash Flow as at Jan 2026\nSimply Wall St performs a discounted cash flow (DCF) on every stock in the world every day (check out BYD for example).

Simplex Holdings (TSE:4373) reported strong revenue and profit growth for the nine months ending December 31, 2025. The company implemented a four-for-one stock split and launched a significant share buyback program. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 20.7x, above the peer average but below its own fair P/E of 24.6x, implying some upside potential. Earnings growth has outpaced the industry with a 56.6% increase over the past year and raised guidance for the future. However, recent short-term stock price gains have slowed, with 30- and 90-day returns of 8.75% and 10.79%, respectively. The market appears to price in robust growth, but questions remain about risks to revenue and net income growth. Investors should watch how Simplex compares with tech and AI peers in Japan's IT sector.\nLATEST ARTICLES\nMicrosoft stock price in focus after AI spending jolt: what to watch before Monday’s open\n1 FEBRUARY 2026\nGOOG stock price: What to watch before Alphabet’s Feb. 4 earnings after Wall Street’s Friday slide\n1 FEBRUARY 2026\nPREVIOUS STORY\nBroadcom stock dips to $320 as Intel shock hits chips; Fed week and VMware dispute loom\nNEXT STORY\nBerkshire Hathaway stock price dips into weekend: BRK.B traders brace for Fed week and BNSF storm", "Content_Length": 4237, "Word_Count": 672, "Image_URLs": [], "News_URL": "https://ts2.tech/en/tencent-stock-slips-into-weekend-as-0700-hk-lags-tech-gauge-what-to-watch-before-monday/", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 1.5746173858642578}

This context helps frame why investors are paying close attention to Tencent's share price moves and what they might mean for risk and opportunity.\nOn our checks, Tencent scores a 5 out of 6 valuation score. This suggests it screens as undervalued on most of the methods we use. Next we will break down those approaches and then finish with a way to think about valuation that goes beyond the usual ratios.\nFind out why Tencent Holdings's 64.0% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Tencent Holdings Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\nA Discounted Cash Flow model takes the cash Tencent Holdings is expected to generate in the future, then discounts those amounts back to what they are worth today to estimate an intrinsic value per share.\nOn this approach, Tencent starts from last twelve month free cash flow of about CN¥201.2b. Analysts provide forecasts for several years, and Simply Wall St then extends those estimates further. By 2029, projected free cash flow is CN¥403.7b, with intermediate years such as 2026 and 2027 sitting in the CN¥258.7b to CN¥310.1b range. Later years gradually increase toward the mid CN¥500b level by 2035 based on extrapolated assumptions.\nWhen all these projected cash flows are discounted back and combined using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the resulting intrinsic value comes out at HK$897.25 per share. Against the recent share price of HK$617.50, this implies the stock screens as around 31.2% undervalued on this method.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Tencent Holdings is undervalued by 31.2%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 872 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.\n700 Discounted Cash Flow as at Jan 2026\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Tencent Holdings.\nApproach 2: Tencent Holdings Price vs Earnings\nFor a profitable company like Tencent, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to see what investors are paying for each unit of current earnings. It helps you compare the share price with the earnings that are already in place, without getting lost in more complex models.\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 3131, "Word_Count": 524, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/am5gubQQMDmRYsiXmIL0Tw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTQyODtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/ec3ec22e89e38a052fa5ef3554d706b9", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2swpW_oPax1dS0x4tgVqCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTM4MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/4c0b685d94c99c21c494bdc657d65c9a", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sWz1SFLzrz6pPtUbuvVx_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY2NDtjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/3748f7748ce18afae2f86ee319f59a4b"], "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-holdings-sehk-700-offering-030904899.html", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 9.462652921676636}
