Much of that value hangs on investors' beliefs that Musk will deliver on lofty promises of delivering robotaxis and humanoid robots backed by the company's investment in artificial intelligence.\nIt joins Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet in planning sharp increases in capital spending this year, as those ‌companies invest heavily in hardware and data centers to support AI model training and customer demand.\nScott Acheychek, chief operating officer of REX Financial, which manages ETFs with exposure to Tesla stock, argued that Tesla's car business was no longer the main focus. \"The bigger story,\" he said, \"is the business model transition now underway\" as Tesla focuses on autonomous driving.\nTesla shares were down 1% in early trading on Thursday.\n'NECESSARY SPENDING'\nAndrew Rocco, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said he viewed the $20 billion as \"necessary spending.\"\n\"If Optimus is going to be a best-selling product, the AI ⁠must be trained as well as possible,\" he said, adding the planned spending gives him confidence that Musk's \"sometimes loose timelines will actually be honored.\"\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 2814, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png"], "Price_At_News_Time": 102.0, "Price_Open": 102.9000015258789, "Price_Close": 102.0, "Price_Change_Percent": -0.8746370384188573, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-29T09:30:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-plans-20-billion-capital-025646787.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 5.527522563934326}

Instead, the company will use that factory space to build humanoid robots instead.\nAnd he seemed to suggest that selling electric vehicles, which Tesla helped to introduce to the global mass market, would soon be an afterthought for the company.\nMusk predicted the Cybercab, a two-seat self-driving “robotaxi” vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals, will eventually be sold in numbers “several times more” than all Tesla’s other vehicles combined.\nRELATED ARTICLE\nTesla’s profit engine is sputtering.

Meanwhile, the company’s EV sales and profits, which it still depends upon for the cash to fund its ambitious autonomous and AI future, continue to decline.\nTesla said Wednesday that its adjusted income fell 16% during the last three months of 2025. Its net income tumbled further, plunging 61% in the quarter and 46% for the year, or a $3.3 billion decline.\nThe company posted its biggest year-over-year sales volume drop ever in the fourth quarter and by far the biggest drop in annual sales at a company that at once been growing at nearly a 50% pace.\nAn electric charging station for Tesla cars in Bochum, Germany.

As of 2025, the company’s annual income is only 30% of the $12.6 billion it was in 2022, its peak earnings year.\nThe brand’s reputation took a hit last year among some American and European buyers – backlash to Musk’s political activities and his close relationship with President Donald Trump. And all US EV sales dropped off later in the year following the elimination of a $7,500 US tax credit for EV buyers.\nTesla also faces increased competition from other automakers, particularly in China, Tesla’s second largest market behind the United States. In fact, Tesla in 2025 lost its title of world’s largest electric vehicle maker to Chinese automaker BYD.\nRELATED VIDEO\nTesla shareholders approve Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package\n0:52\nThe end of the Model S and Model X will have a limited impact on Tesla’s sales.

The AI company, which Musk owns and started in 2023, also owns his social media platform, X.\nThe promise of robotaxis and robots was enough to lift the stock to a record level in December, although it has retreated somewhat since that peak.\nShares of Tesla (TSLA) rose slightly in after-hours trading after the company said in its earnings statement that it planned to expand its robotaxi service to seven markets in the first half of this year. That’s on top of the two it currently serves.\nThe company previously said that its robotaxi service would serve half of the US population by the end of 2025. Musk reiterated that goal on Wednesday, saying between a quarter to half of the United States will have fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2026, “pending regulatory approval.”\nThe story has been updated with additional details.", "Content_Length": 3938, "Image_URLs": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190117152549-chris-isidore-byline.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_50,h_50", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1322378070.jpg?c=original&q=w_860,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25173749904431.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2240736585.jpg?c=original&q=w_860,c_fill", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/251106-teslavote-wide-00-00-57-13-still001.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_720,w_1280,c_fill/w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1434797482.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_253,w_450,c_fill/c_thumb,g_auto,w_450,h_253", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2249102878.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_253,w_450,c_fill/c_thumb,g_auto,w_450,h_253", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/weekly-launches-jan-16-2026.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_253,w_450,c_fill/c_thumb,g_auto,w_450,h_253", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256863144.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_253,w_450,c_fill/c_thumb,g_auto,w_450,h_253", "https://edition.cnn.com/media/sites/cnn/google-play-cnn-app-qr-code.png", "https://edition.cnn.com/media/sites/cnn/app-store-cnn-app-qr-code.png"], "Price_At_News_Time": 102.80000305175781, "Price_Open": 102.0, "Price_Close": 102.80000305175781, "Price_Change_Percent": 0.7843167174096201, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-28T15:30:00", "News_URL": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/business/tesla-q4-2025-earnings?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 7.961390018463135}

(BYDDY). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\nCurrently, Volkswagen AG Unsponsored ADR has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Byd Co., Ltd. has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VWAGY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nVWAGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.38, while BYDDY has a forward P/E of 17.64. We also note that VWAGY has a PEG ratio of 1.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BYDDY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.39.\nAnother notable valuation metric for VWAGY is its P/B ratio of 0.27. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BYDDY has a P/B of 3.34.\nThese metrics, and several others, help VWAGY earn a Value grade of A, while BYDDY has been given a Value grade of C.\nVWAGY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

(BYDDY). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.\nWe have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.\nCurrently, Volkswagen AG Unsponsored ADR has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Byd Co., Ltd. has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that VWAGY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.\nValue investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.\nThe Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.\nVWAGY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.38, while BYDDY has a forward P/E of 17.64. We also note that VWAGY has a PEG ratio of 1.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BYDDY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.39.\nAnother notable valuation metric for VWAGY is its P/B ratio of 0.27. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BYDDY has a P/B of 3.34.\nThese metrics, and several others, help VWAGY earn a Value grade of A, while BYDDY has been given a Value grade of C.\nVWAGY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that VWAGY is likely the superior value option right now.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As Musk’s SpaceX prepares for a high-profile IPO, China’s growing ambitions in orbital artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are adding a new layer of competition.\nBYD Dethrones Tesla\nIn 2025, BYD overtook Tesla to become the world’s largest EV seller for the first time on an annual sales basis. BYD sold around 2.25 million electric-powered vehicles, up roughly 28% year over year. Tesla, meanwhile, reported two straight years of falling sales and profits. Several factors weighed on Tesla, including an aging product lineup and stiff competition from Chinese automakers. Also, investors grew uneasy about Musk’s political involvement. BYD, on the other hand, benefited from scale, pricing power and strong domestic demand in China.\nBut what began as competition around Tesla is now expanding into other areas of Musk’s technology empire.\nChina Enters the Space AI Race\nChina’s primary space contractor, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (“CASC”), has announced plans to launch space-based AI data centers over the next five years, per Reuters. These systems aim to integrate cloud, edge and device-level computing.\nBasically, China wants data collected on Earth to be processed directly in orbit. This approach could improve speed, reduce transmission needs and allow more complex AI tasks to run off-planet.\nThe timing is striking. Just as SpaceX is contemplating an IPO centered on orbital AI ambitions, China is signaling that it plans to compete head-on in the same space. After BYD dethroned Tesla in EVs, the parallels are hard to ignore.\nSpaceX’s Big Bet: AI Data Centers in Orbit\nSpaceX is preparing for what could be one of the largest IPOs in recent history. A major part of that story is AI.\nMusk wants SpaceX to deploy AI data centers in orbit. Data centers on Earth are running into energy limits. Power grids are stretched, electricity costs are rising and cooling massive AI servers is becoming harder. Space, by contrast, offers abundant solar energy and natural cooling.\nSpaceX plans to launch solar-powered AI data center satellites within the next two to three years. These orbital systems could process data directly in space, reducing pressure on Earth-based infrastructure and opening new possibilities for AI workloads.\nSpaceX is not alone in this race. Several global technology leaders, including Alphabet GOOGL, NVIDIA NVDA and Blue Origin, are actively exploring space-based data centers.\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 2854, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png"], "Price_At_News_Time": 97.69999694824219, "Price_Open": 97.94999694824219, "Price_Close": 97.69999694824219, "Price_Change_Percent": -0.25523226930992415, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-30T13:30:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beating-tsla-evs-china-eyeing-130300588.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 4.517221212387085}

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 5, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis casino operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.1%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1.01 billion, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.73% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for BYD\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nStory Continues\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 3160, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vFi_h5vT6ZX_h9XNJGSpCw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU3MztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/63ae7007943ba7eaed2425ee607ccf93"], "Price_At_News_Time": 101.80000305175781, "Price_Open": 101.0, "Price_Close": 101.80000305175781, "Price_Change_Percent": 0.7920822294631807, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-29T15:30:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-boyd-gaming-byd-150006577.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 3.8059377670288086}

NEVs included fully battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and a tiny number of fuel-cell vehicles.\nWhile a big drop-off from December is typical, especially with some EV incentives scaled down on Jan. 1, the year-over-year gain isn't that impressive given that Lunar New Year isn't until Feb. 17 vs. Jan. 29 in 2025. Factories tend to shut down for a week or so around Lunar New Year as hundreds of millions of people travel, slashing production and demand.\nIt's best to look at January-February sales combined vs. a year earlier, or even the full first quarter, to get a real sense of trends. China EV sales tend to ramp up in the spring, as a bevy of new or refreshed models hit the streets.\nXiaomi Deliveries\nXiaomi delivered over 39,000 vehicles in January, according to CNEVPost.com, citing a Weibo post. That's down from 50,212 in December, according to industry figures, but up from  22,897 in January 2025.\nXiaomi is Tesla's most-direct competitor, with its SU7 sedan competing with the Model 3 while the YU7 crossover takes on the Model 7. The SU7 easily outsold the Tesla Model 3 in China last year, with strong pre-orders for a refreshed version due this spring. The YU7, which launched last year, is getting closer to matching Model Y sales in the country. Xiaomi, which gets the bulk of its revenue from wireless handsets, plans to roll out further models this year beyond its two BEV offerings.\nLi Auto Deliveries\nLi Auto delivered 27,668 units, down 37.5% vs. December and off 7.5% vs. January 2025.\nLi Auto is mostly known for its EREV SUVs, but it has a BEV minivan and now some BEV SUVs. Li Auto sales have struggled for some time.\nOther China EV Makers\nXPeng also competes in Tesla's mainstream market, but with a variety of models. XPeng has traditionally made only BEVs, but it's recently entered the extended-range electric vehicle field. EREVs are essentially a kind of PHEV. XPeng sales boomed in 2025 but had a disappointing fourth quarter.\nXPeng is exporting more and will soon mass produce cars at an Austria factory run by Magna International (MGA). That will let XPeng sidestep European Union tariffs on Chinese-made EVs.\nNio has its upscale namesake brand, as well as the mainstream Onvo and affordable Firefly lines. Onvo has been the biggest contributor recently.\nBYD will report January sales on Sunday or Monday. It's the world's largest EV maker, easily beating Tesla in BEVs last year. But BYD, especially its affordable BYD brand, saw significant sales declines in China. Its FCB off-road vehicle line was a strong performer. BYD relied heavily on surging overseas sales to achieve growth last year, but they were far below the company's original targets. A Hungary plant is expected to begin mass production in the second quarter, as part of a rapid expansion of overseas plants.\nTesla saw China sales decline slightly last year, even with the refreshed Model Y and the launch of the extended-wheelbase Model Y L. The U.S. EV giant did have a strong end to 2025. But in 2026, the only likely new offering is a stripped-down Model Y and 3. Those vehicles haven't sold especially well in the U.S. or Europe since their launches in late 2025, and China's affordable EV maker is extremely competitive.\nA few weeks ago, Tesla introduced a seven-year, low-rate financing plan, a move followed by Xiaomi, Li Auto, XPeng, Nio and more.\nFord Eyeing China EV Partnership?\nFord Motor (F) has held talks with Xiaomi about a possible joint venture to make Xiaomi EVs in the U.S., The Financial Times reported Saturday, citing sources. Ford also has had some discussions with BYD and other China EV makers, FT said. Such a move would be a bombshell for the U.S. auto industry, and politically controversial.\nHowever, President Donald Trump has at times said he's open to China EV makers setting up assembly plants in the U.S., including during a January visit to the Ford truck plant in Dearborn, Michigan.\nFord said the report \"is completely false.\"\nChina EV Stocks\nChina EV stocks have had a tough start to 2026. BYD's U.S. shares were up 2.2% in January after skidding for much of last year. Meanwhile, Li Auto has lost 1.8%, Nio 7.8%, Xiaomi 10% and XPeng 11.3%.\nTesla stock is down 4.3% so far this year, though it boun", "Content_Length": 5483, "Image_URLs": ["https://pdx1.qualtrics.com/WRQualtricsSiteIntercept/Graphic.php?IM=IM_6hP1YXQgxx89mN8"], "Price_At_News_Time": 97.75, "Price_Open": 97.8499984741211, "Price_Close": 97.75, "Price_Change_Percent": -0.10219568286200932, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-30T15:30:00", "News_URL": "https://www.investors.com/news/teslas-china-ev-rivals-xiaomi-xpeng-nio-byd-january-sales-lunar-new-year/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 8.404314756393433}

The company's processors help cameras and vehicles process visual data in real time.\nAxera said it was the largest provider ⁠of mid-to-high-end visual on-device AI inference chips globally by shipments in 2024, citing research firm China Insights Industry Consultancy (CIC) in the filing.\nFor the first nine months of 2025, its revenue rose 5.8% to 269.0 million yuan ($38.7 ‍million) from 254.2 million ⁠yuan a year earlier, while net loss widened to 855.7 million yuan from 691.0 million yuan, the filing showed.\nCICC, Guotai Junan International and ⁠BOCOM International are sponsors of the IPO.\n($1 = 7.8053 Hong Kong dollars)\n($1 = 6.9480 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by ‌Kumar Tanishk in Bengaluru and Yantoultra Ngui in Singapore; Editing ‌by Pooja Desai and Varun H K)\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 2355, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png"], "Price_At_News_Time": 622.0, "Price_Open": 621.5, "Price_Close": 622.0, "Price_Change_Percent": 0.08045052292839903, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-29T15:30:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-ai-chipmaker-axera-semiconductor-230920676.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 4.0000715255737305}

In an effort to ease trade tensions with the U.S., China has allowed Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent to buy H200 AI chips from the U.S. firm. The government has approved the purchase of over 400,000 H200 chips in total, with other tech firms joining the race for subsequent approvals, Reuters reported.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Alibaba (BABA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nAlibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.28, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 25 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.28 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 25 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88% and 4% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for BABA\nBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for BABA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alibaba here>>>\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alibaba, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions.

He added that he believed that China was still finalising the licence.

These conditions are being decided by ‍China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), according to one of the people.\nChina's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Commerce and NDRC did not answer requests for comment.\nDeepSeek, which rattled the global tech sector early last year by rolling out AI models that cost ‌a fraction of those being developed by U.S. rivals such as OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), did not answer a request for comment.\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been the main barrier to shipments.\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally ⁠cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be shipped in.\nAny purchases of H200 chips by DeepSeek could draw ‍scrutiny by U.S lawmakers. ⁠Reuters reported on Wednesday that a senior U.S lawmaker had alleged that Nvidia had helped DeepSeek hone artificial intelligence models that were later used by the Chinese military, ⁠according to a letter sent to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\nDeepSeek is expected to launch its next-generation AI ‌model V4, featuring strong coding capabilities, in mid-February, The Information reported earlier this ‌month.\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard", "Content_Length": 2914, "Image_URLs": ["https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/1027.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/52.png", "https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/5426.png"], "Price_At_News_Time": 167.60000610351562, "Price_Open": 170.1999969482422, "Price_Close": 167.60000610351562, "Price_Change_Percent": -1.5276092193569308, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-30T09:30:00", "News_URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-china-conditionally-approves-deepseek-065114403.html?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 3.879809856414795}

The analyst, who set a $6.20 price target for the stock, noted that the company’s valuation became more attractive as a result of lowered expectations and a stock selloff. Nonetheless, HSBC expects Grab to retain its growth drivers, particularly its ability to launch affordable services.\ngrab, motorcycle, road, helmet, taxi\nPhoto by Afif Ramdhasuma on Unsplash\nMeanwhile, CGS-CIMB also assigned a “Buy” rating on Grab Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ:GRAB) stock, with a $7.20 target price, expecting the company to see positive adjusted EBITDA across all business segments in fiscal year 2027, aided by increased earnings from its advertising business and a break-even trajectory for its financial services segment. However, CGS-CIMB cautioned about key risks for Grab, including credit losses and regional corporate costs. Grab also received two other “Buy” ratings this month: from Barclays on January 15, with a $7 price target, and from UBS on January 7.\nGrab Holdings Ltd (NASDAQ:GRAB), Southeast Asia’s answer to Uber, is one of the best tech stocks under $10 to buy. The company operates deliveries, mobility, and digital financial services in eight countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GRAB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the Buzzing AI Stocks on Wall Street. On January 28, HSBC analyst Abhishek Shukla lowered the price target on the stock to $41.00 (from $44.00) while maintaining a Reduce rating. The firm believes that CoreWeave’s ongoing funding needs and high cost of capital may impact long-term productivity.\nThe firm has increased its interest cost estimates for CoreWeave due to a 250 basis points widening in the company’s credit default spread (CDS) spreads by the third quarter of 2025. This implies that the company will need to pay more than 10% yield for raising fresh debts. In 3Q25, CoreWeave was able to raise fresh debt at about 9% effective interest rate for the company, an assumption which the firm no longer views as sustainable.\nHSBC noted that while the company’s January 2026 $2 billion equity from Nvidia and its December issuance of 1.75% convertible notes may help put a lid on near-term interest costs, CRWV still likely faces a liquidity shortfall of USD 8.9 billion in 2026e.\nHSBC Cuts CoreWeave (CRWV) Price Target, Flags High Funding Needs and Rising Debt Costs\nPhoto by lucas law on Unsplash\nAs a result, the firm believes that the company will likely need to borrow more funds at current higher yields, in turn increasing its effective cost of debt.\n“Consensus continues to assume that the effective interest rate on debt for CoreWeave will dip to 7.7% in 2029e from 9.9% in 3Q25. We lower our 2027-30e non GAAP EPS estimates by 12-33% (on a very low base) due to higher interest expense. 2026e non-GAAP EPS, however, rises to USD0.15 (from negative USD0.06) on lower debt. Our 2027-30e non-GAAP EPS estimates remain 58-92% below consensus.”\nCoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is a cloud platform provider that provides equipment for AI and other computing purposes.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

One may be a supplier, while another markets products. Another may be a designer, while another uses its products. As a result, investors can look for clues about one stock in other companies' earnings reports.\nRecently, I saw one such huge connection in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's\n(\nTSM\n2.65%\n)\nfourth-quarter earnings report. TSMC, as it's also known, is the world's primary foundry for producing logic chips and supplies them to nearly every company in cutting-edge tech. One of its biggest clients is Nvidia\n(\nNVDA\n0.72%\n)\n, and the news that TSMC just delivered is huge for that client.\nTSMC's dominance makes it easy to trace beneficiaries\nThe world of logic-chip foundries is fairly small. There is TSMC and some lesser competitors that don't have the same level of dominance, such as Samsung. TSMC is really the only name in town after Intel's fall from grace. So, when the leading chip producer says that something good (or bad) is happening with demand, it's pretty easy to trace its downstream effects.\nDuring the company's fourth-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said that his company has increased its projection for artificial intelligence (AI) chips to a mid- to high-50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the period between 2024 and 2029. That's monstrous growth, and bodes well for some other predictions that Nvidia has already given shareholders.\nCollapse\nNYSE: TSM\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nToday's Change\n(-2.65%) $-8.99\nCurrent Price\n$330.56\nTSM\nYTD\n1W\n1M\n3M\n6M\n1Y\n5Y\nPRICE\nVS S&P\nKEY DATA POINTS\nMarket Cap\n$1.7T\nDay's Range\n$329.10 - $339.90\n52wk Range\n$134.25 - $351.33\nVolume\n12M\nAvg Vol\n13M\nGross Margin\n59.02%\nDividend Yield\n0.93%\nNvidia told investors that it expects global data-center capital expenditures to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. That equates to a 42% CAGR over that time frame, which is slightly less than what TSMC expects.\nThese two projections aren't exactly the same, but they are close enough that I think investors can take TSMC's projection as a confirmation of Nvidia's. This could be huge for the latter company since it would make an enormous amount of revenue in 2030 if it comes true.\nNvidia could come close to $1 trillion in revenue if the projection pans out\nWall Street analysts expect $213 billion in revenue for Nvidia's fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026). Should the company's revenue check in at a 42% CAGR during the next four years through 2030, that would give it revenue of $866 billion. It would be quite the feat for the largest company in the world by market cap to quadruple revenue in four years, and would make it a no-brainer buy now if its projection pans out.\nThat would require Nvidia to maintain its market share, which won't be easy to do. However, I think it's certainly in a strong position to continue growing rapidly during the next four years, and investors who don't have exposure to Nvidia should think about changing that.\nCollapse\nNASDAQ: NVDA\nNvidia\nToday's Change\n(-0.72%) $-1.38\nCurrent Price\n$191.13\nNVDA\nYTD\n1W\n1M\n3M\n6M\n1Y\n5Y\nPRICE\nVS S&P\nKEY DATA POINTS\nMarket Cap\n$4.6T\nDay's Range\n$189.47 - $194.49\n52wk Range\n$86.62 - $212.19\nVolume\n179M\nAvg Vol\n182M\nGross Margin\n70.05%\nDividend Yield\n0.02%\nOne apprehension many investors have is the fear of an AI bubble. If one forms, it would likely affect Nvidia's stock. Taiwan Semiconductor's CEO has the same concern. He mentioned that he is \"very nervous\" about AI demand.\nHowever, he said his company did a lot of research and checked in with its biggest clients before making the decision to invest more than $50 billion in chip production capabilities. If it's wrong, Wei cautioned, TSMC is in trouble. However, he is very confident that the research is right, especially because he spent a significant amount of time in the past quarter ensuring demand is real.\nI think this should ease some fears about an AI bubble, because companies are doing their due diligence to ensure that AI demand is something that's here to stay. If it is, stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Nvidia have plenty of room to soar. I think each is an excellent investment option in 2026, and if you don't own them already, now is the perfect time to load up.", "Content_Length": 4361, "Image_URLs": ["https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F853367%2Fgettyimages-ai-chip-on-a-circuit-board.jpg&w=3840&op=resize", "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F853692%2F371-tsmc.png&w=3840&op=resize", "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851756%2Fperson-buying-a-stock-while-using-a-computer-and-a-tablet.jpg&w=3840&op=resize", "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F853107%2Fbuffett9-tmf.jpg&w=3840&op=resize", "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F852753%2Fa-person-holding-up-an-artificial-intelligence-chip.jpg&w=3840&op=resize", "https://a.pub.network/core/imgs/1.png?x=2026-02-01T11%3A45%3A24.407", "https://a.pub.network/core/imgs/1.png?x=2026-02-01T11%3A45%3A24.740"], "Price_At_News_Time": 76.75, "Price_Open": 77.30000305175781, "Price_Close": 76.75, "Price_Change_Percent": -0.7115175032911015, "Price_Timestamp": "2026-01-22T10:30:00", "News_URL": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/22/taiwan-semiconductor-just-delivered-increible-news/?.tsrc=rss", "Scrape_Time_Sec": 5.033769130706787}
